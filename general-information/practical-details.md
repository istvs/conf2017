# Practical Details

The official language of the ISTVS Conference 2017 is English. No translation is provided.

### Electricity

The electricity is 230 V, 50 Hz. Japanese, UK, USA and other visitors: please note that in Hungary Continental European [German-style CEE7/4 sockets](http://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets/f/) (“Schuko sockets“) are used, which also accepts [CEE7/16 “Europlugs“](http://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets/c/).

### Tap Water

Tap water is filtered and purified and safe to drink.

### Foreign Exchange, Banking Facilities

The official national Hungarian currency is the Hungarian Forint (HUF). All the major credit cards are accepted in Hungary in places displaying the emblem at the entrance. Though Hungary is a member of the European Union, only a few shops and restaurants accept Euros (EUR) for payment. Currency exchange booths are available in Budapest at the airport terminals, railway stations, travel agencies, banks and various places in the city. The exchange rates applied may vary. [Click here](http://www.mnb.hu/en/arfolyamok) to see the actual official exchange rates. Traveller’s cheques and convertible currency may be exchanged at these facilities. Major credit cards are usually accepted in most hotels, restaurants and certain shops in the city. Obtaining cash against ATM or credit cards is very easy from the ATM cash machines that can be found at almost each bank office, hotel or on the street.

### Liability and Insurance

The organisers cannot accept liability for any personal accidents, loss of belongings or damage to private property of participants and accompanying persons that may occur during the Conference. Participants are advised to make their own arrangements to obtain health, travel and property insurance before their departure to Hungary.

### Shopping in Budapest (opening hours)

Opening hours of most shops are generally between 10 AM and 6 PM on workdays, and until 1 PM on Saturdays. Some shops and supermarkets are open on Sunday too. The shopping malls are a general exception, as their opening times are uniform for all shops in a given mall, and are longer than usual: Monday through Saturday 9 AM – 9 PM, Sunday 10 AM – 7 PM. Some larger supermarkets, such as Tesco, have units that are open 24 hours a day.

* Office hours: generally from 8 AM – 4 PM Mon – Fri.
* Post offices: Mon – Fri: 8 AM – 6 PM, Sat: 8 AM – 1 PM
* Banks: Mon – Thu: 8 AM – 3 PM, Fri: 8 AM – 1 PM.

### Taxis in Budapest

Budapest taxis have yellow number plates and a taxi sign in yellow. Any vehicle without these features is operating illegally. It’s a good idea to avoid drivers who volunteer their services but don’t have a registered taxi sticker on their car. This can prevent unpleasant surprises when it comes time to pay. All cars must have a taximeter installed, and these also print out a receipt. Taxi drivers are required to give an invoice on request. Tipping: in general 10% of the fare is acceptable. The total charge that has to be paid by the passenger is made up of three separate parts: the basic charge, which is irrespective of how far the journey is, presently HUF 450 during day and night, a per kilometre charge which depends on how many kilometres are covered during the journey HUF 280/km, and the waiting charge which is HUF 70/min. From 1 September 2013 a new regulation came to force which regulates the taxi fares. No fixed, shuttle or pre-agreed prices are available any more.

### Telephone

The international code for Hungary is 36, the area code for Budapest is 1. To call a number within Hungary, first dial +36 or 0036. Budapest telephone numbers have seven digits; all other areas have six digits (in addition to the area codes). To make an international call from Hungary, first dial 00, then the country code followed by the area code and the subscriber’s telephone number.
