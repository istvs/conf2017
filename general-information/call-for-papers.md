The International Society for Terrain Vehicle Systems (ISTVS) is an educational, non-profit, and non-political organization whose mission is to promote activities that help acquire and advance knowledge of the mechanics of terrain-vehicle systems and machinery interacting with soils in all environments. All ISTVS present and past members, students, and non-member professionals in the field are cordially invited to join us in Budapest for the 19th International & 14th European-African Regional Conference of the ISTVS.

Technical tracks are listed below for paper submission:

* Track 1: Terramechanics, terrain/soil-wheel/tire/track interaction, modelling and characterization
* Track 2: Advances in mobility, energy transfer, efficiency, ground vehicle dynamics, safety
* Track 3: Land locomotion, off-road and military vehicles, operation snow and ice
* Track 4: Agricultural, forestry, construction, and mining equipment and vehicles
* Track 5: Mobile robotics for ground applications, planet exploration and other environments
* Track 6: Innovative system designs for terrain and road-vehicle applications

All papers will be peer-reviewed, and those accepted will be included in the conference proceedings. We strongly encourage all authors to submit full papers, but will also accept oral presentations, for which only an abstract needs to be submitted.
